# PuppySignal

PuppySignal is an application designed for tracking our pets.

While purchasing a small tag for our pets is always beneficial, imagine if you could create a QR code tag. With this feature, if anyone finds your pet, they would have access to its information as well as the contact details of its owners.

At the same time, you would be notified right on your phone that someone scanned it, and the location if the person decides to share it.
